### Introduction
MoLing is a computer-use and browser-use MCP Server that implements system interaction through operating system APIs, enabling file system operations such as reading, writing, merging, statistics, and aggregation, as well as the ability to execute system commands. It is a dependency-free local office automation assistant.

### Advantages
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requiring no installation of any dependencies, MoLing can be run directly and is compatible with multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. 
> This eliminates the hassle of dealing with environment conflicts involving Node.js, Python, Docker and other development environments.

### Features

> [!CAUTION]
> Command-line operations are dangerous and should be used with caution.

- **File System Operations**: Reading, writing, merging, statistics, and aggregation
- **Command-line Terminal**: Execute system commands directly
- **Browser Control**: Powered by `github.com/chromedp/chromedp`
    - Chrome browser is required.
    - In Windows, the full path to Chrome needs to be configured in the system environment variables.
- **Future Plans**:
    - Personal PC data organization
    - Document writing assistance
    - Schedule planning
    - Life assistant features

> [!WARNING]
> Currently, MoLing has only been tested on macOS, and other operating systems may have issues.

#### Configuration Format

##### MCP Server (MoLing) configuration

The configuration file will be generated at `/Users/username/.moling/config/config.json`, and you can modify its
contents as needed.

If the file does not exist, you can create it using `moling config --init`.

##### MCP Client configuration
For example, to configure the Claude client, add the following configuration:

> [!TIP]
> 
> Only 3-6 lines of configuration are needed.
> 
> Claude config path: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MoLing MineCraft": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/moling_mc",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

and, `/usr/local/bin/moling` is the path to the MoLing server binary you downloaded.

**Automatic Configuration**

run `moling client --install` to automatically install the configuration for the MCP client.

MoLing will automatically detect the MCP client and install the configuration for you. including: Cline, Claude, Roo
